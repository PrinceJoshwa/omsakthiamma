      content="In these Holy Lands at Melmaruvathur, where the current Siddhar Peedam is consecrated, stood a Neem tree and a huge Snake mound underneath it.  One day, in 1960s, milk began to ooze out from the aforesaid Neem Tree.  Wonderstruck by the miracle, people in the surrounding villages, thinking it to be a Divine Happening, drank the oozing milk.  The milk was delicious though the sap of the Neem tree will always taste bitter.  It served as a miracle-medicine for curing the various diseases of the village people. The people slowly started realizing the Divine Power and Grace of the tree.
On 28th November 1966, there was a violent storm in Tamil Nadu. The Snake mound under the Neem tree was eroded in the heavy rain. The Neem tree (from which the milk oozed out) also got uprooted due to the violent gusty winds.The Swayambu (Swayambu means “self-manifested” or that which is created by its own accord) emerged beneath the uprooted Neem tree. People then understood the revelation that it was because of the power of The Swayambu, the milk had high medicinal values, and the place became so sacred. The Sanctum Sanctorum of today’s SiddharPeedam is established in this very same place. The Swayambu is situated right in front of the Adhiparasakthi statue.
In 1971, the first Oracle came through His Holiness, The Adigalar and The Power prophesied that, “it’s descending to earth as The Mother and She should be worshipped as the Goddess Adhiparasakthi, and the world would go through a Spiritual Revolution and a New Renaissance would emerge’.
Initially, The Swayambu alone was worshipped for many years. Thereafter, on 25thNovember 1977, the idol of Mother Adhiparasakthi was installed in the Sanctum Sanctorum. Mother Adhiparasakthi instructed the unique form of this idol through Her Oracles. The idol is one metre tall, seated on a thousand-petal lotus seat, with Her right leg folded and the left leg resting on the lotus petal. The thousand-petal lotus signifies and denotes meditation. She holds the bud of a lotus in Her right hand and the fingers of Her left are folded in a way depicting the Chin Mudra. Her hair is plaited and knotted upwards like a crown."
