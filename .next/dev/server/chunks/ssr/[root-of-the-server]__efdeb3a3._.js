        content: "ASTONISHING MIRACLES OF AMMA Amma, who has been rightly realised by lakhs and lakhs of devotees, as the true Avatar of Adhiparasakthi, has performed innumerable miracles, ascertained by the devotees themselves. His Holiness, the Amma had appeared in their dreams and had cured many incurable diseases by His mere graceful look or by suggesting remedies beyond a common man’s comprehension. His Holiness, the Amma had also solved complex and intricate problems in the lives of devotees.  The spiritual magazine, Sakthi Oli, rolled out from the Siddhar Peedam carries first hand information about these miracles.  Each devotee, of this Holy soil, invariably has experienced one or more miracles showered on him/herby Amma, and they very eagerly and benignly share them with others. This can be more clearly understood only on personally experiencing Amma’s grace.  EARTHQUAKE FORESEEN Earthquake in America: When a devotee went to meet Amma with another devotee to discuss some administrative issues, Amma suddenly intervened and told him, “Ask your second son-in-law to sell his house in the U.S. and shift homes immediately. There will be an earthquake there.”  The devotee, perplexed, communicated this to his second son-in-law and stressed that it was the Mother’s wish to shift homes immediately. The son-in-law reluctantly initiated the process, since he hadn’t been told the reason. Right enough, soon after the couple moved, there was an earthquake in the region. Not just from natural disasters, Amma has also healed many by gently touching them with neem leaves and passing on Her powers.  NEEM LEAF TURNED INTO A BEETLE Once a devotee wondered why the Mother used the neem leaf, like some village deity, for healing people. Though this was not explicitly revealed in Her divine presence, the All-Knowing Amma called the devotee and handed him a neem leaf. “Now, close your fingers and open them again ”, She commanded him. Much to his and everyone’s surprise, the leaf had turned into a black beetle that was alive, which crawled and moved as per Amma’s directions.  CURING CHICKEN POX In those days, chicken pox was associated with the Divine Mother, and it was customary to recite the Mariyamman Thalattu (lullaby) in front of the patient. Humbled by His display of power and involvement, His Holiness was honoured by the villagers to recite the passages describing the Divine Mother. The patient would gradually calm down and would be much at ease.  THE EVER-CONTINUING MIRACLES OF THE DIVINE MOTHER Dr.T. P.Meenakshisunndaram, the first Vice chancellor of Madurai (Kamaraj) University, a disciple of Maharashi Mahesh yogi, visited the Divine Mother, out of curiosity. He saw the Divine Mother blessing devotees by gently passing neem leaves over their heads and was puzzled to see gold ornaments materializing. Amma told him, “This is not for you,” and continued with Her routine actions and miracles.  MIRACLES IN THE MEDICAL FIELD The next time the Dr.came, he was amazed to see Her treating a woman with acute Ankylosing Spondilitis. The suffering lady was knotted in an ellipsoidal position and had to be carried to the Mother for treatment. His Holiness stepped on the lady and pressed her back twice. When His Holiness stepped down, the woman was able to stand on her own, erect!  Dr.T. P. M. became an ardent devotee of the Divine Mother after She spoke to him once even without him seeking Her out explicitly. Later in his life, the Dr. was severely suffering from filariasis and was being treated for unbearable pain in his legs. The Divine Mother called a devotee and told him, “He is suffering from cancer; change the treatment”. When he was admitted to the cancer hospital, the Dr. Was indeed diagnosed with cancer; but, it was in the very advanced stage. “Tell him not to worry and ask him to bear the pain for some more time. This is his last birth”, The Divine Mother advised. The Dr. abided by Her advise and was even able to visit the Siddhar Peedam after some time to get Herdivine blessings.  THE HEALING POWER BEYOND RELIGIONS Amma’s healing power knew no bounds and went beyond religious barriers. Mumtaz, a Muslim lady, was married to a Hindu, Balakrishnan. Once, she developed a swelling in her right knee, which, no one was able to diagnose. At that time, an ardent devotee of The Mother had a dream, where he saw this couple in a Devi temple. He narrated this dream to the husband and requested them to visit Melmaruvathur.  When Mumtaz met the Mother, She first chanted from the Koran in chaste Arabic and then orderly told the woman of how they had visited the various Devi temples in Kanchipuram and Thiruverkadu. “I shall cure you”, She said, and prescribed a medicine, which cured the lady completely. Not only did the Divine Mother shower Her blessings on this lady, but also stressed that all religions are equal in Her eyes.  On another occasion, another well-educated Muslim gentleman visited The Mother, because he was suffering from cancer, and all medicines had failed him. When he met The Mother, she quoted from the Koran and then questioned, “Why have you given your name as Subramanian? All religions are the same. I am The Mother, I am Allah”. So saying, She gave him the Sacred Ash to smear on his body, which eventually cured him completely."
